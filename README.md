## Overview

Welcome to the **reemathareja-python** repository! This repository contains my solutions to Python programming exercises from the book **Python Programming** by **Reema Thareja**. Each solution is organized by chapter and problem number, making it easy to navigate through different exercises and understand the solutions.

## Repository Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Chapter-wise Folders**: Each chapter from the book has its own folder.
- **Exercise Files**: Inside each chapter folder, you'll find Python files named according to the problem numbers (e.g., `exercise_1_1.py` for Chapter 1, Exercise 1).

## Usage

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhiseksarkar2001/reemathareja-python.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the desired chapter folder.
3. Run the Python file using the command:
   ```bash
